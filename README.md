The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Modularity and Maintainability:** The project is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. It utilizes the repository pattern to separate data access logic from business logic, making it easier to change data sources or add new features without affecting the entire application.

2. **Dependency Injection:** The project leverages dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability and maintainability. By using a DI container, the application can resolve dependencies and inject them into classes at runtime.

3. **Unit of Work Pattern:** The unit of work pattern is implemented to manage transactions and ensure that a consistent and coherent view of the data is maintained during complex operations.

4. **Commonly Used Design Patterns:** The project incorporates commonly used design patterns, such as Factory, Singleton, Observer, and Strategy patterns, to solve various design problems and promote flexible and scalable code.

## Technologies Used

The Ecommerce Website .NET project is built using the following technologies:

- .NET Core: The core framework for building the application.
- C#: The primary programming language used for development.
- ASP.NET Core: Used for building the web application and APIs.
- Entity Framework Core: Utilized for data access and ORM functionality.
- Dependency Injection Container (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection): For managing and injecting dependencies.
- Unit Testing Framework (e.g., MSTest, NUnit, or XUnit): For implementing test cases.

## Getting Started

To run the Ecommerce Website application, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install the .NET SDK on your machine.
   - Make sure you have a database (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite) set up and accessible.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/se348/ShopAPI.git
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Modify the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your database.
   - Run database migrations to create the required tables:
     ```
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Explore and Test:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
   - Test various features of the ecommerce website and explore different functionalities.
